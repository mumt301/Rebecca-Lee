                        Young Pianists’ Competition and the Toronto International Bach Piano Competition, and placing third in the Robert Casadesus International Piano Competition. It was in these competitions where she gained international recognition,
                        eventually winning four Junos. With endorsement from Hyperion Records, she made an award-winning cycle on Bach’s music, but also doing many recording of other composers, such as Liszt, Schumann, Rameau, Mozart, Haydn, Granados,
                        Debussy, Ravel and many more. Hewitt has also partnered up with many other artists, giving masterclasses and performing worldwide as a soloist and with orchestra. During the pandemic, she has produced videos daily of her playing
