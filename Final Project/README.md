# CHRISTMAS JUKEBOX

This Christmas Jukebox is for my MUMT 301 Final Project. This project is done completely using HTML, CSS and JavaScript.  No external stylesheets or libraries were used.  I do not own any of the audio files and songs used for the Jukebox.

## USAGE

There are two modes to choose from - Single Mode and Playlist Mode.  Essentially, both modes work very similarly. Based on the number coins inserted (number of clicks on the Coin button), the user can select up to that many songs from the song bank.  The Return button allows you to return all the coins you have inserted, before the Play button is pressed.  Click on the green numbered buttons (or ?? button which will pick out a random song from the song bank) to select a song and press the Play button to play the song.  If multiple green buttons are clicked, the last song(s) selected (displayed for Single mode) will be played, based on the order the buttons were clicked and the number of coins inserted.  The Stop button will stop the current song.

**Single Mode:** Only one coin can be inserted at a time, and thus only one song will be played.  The Skip Song button does not work in this mode, as there is no next song to go to, only the Stop button will work.

**Playlist Mode:** Up to 10 coins can be inserted at a time, and thus up to 10 songs can be played.  The Skip Song button allows for the next song to be played, stopping the audio for the current song and playing the audio for the next song.  The Stop button not only stops the current song, it will also *clear the playlist*.  If more songs are selected, only the last "coins" number of songs will be played.  If more coins are inserted than songs selected, after the playlist is done, the user can select "remaining amount of coins" songs or press Return to get the coins back.

## DEPENDENCIES

No external stylesheets or libraries were used.  The appearance and display will vary depending on the OS, screen size, and aspect ratio.
