    <p>Hi! My name is Rebecca Lee and I am a second-year undergraduate student studying a Bachelors of Music in organ performance with a minor in Musical Applications of Technology. During my free time, I like read and play board games with my family. I
        enjoy listening to a variety of genres of music but my favourites include film music and piano music.
